Copy the code in ml_model.py to a Google Colab file I shared with you. I also added the google colab content inside ml_model.py
Use the Kaggle API key to connect to the dataset. Make sure to sepeate the code into cells. This code should handle the overfitting issue.
Once the Google Colab was finished running, download the files. The Colab code saves models to Google Drive at:
/content/drive/MyDrive/skin_disease_models/final_enhanced_model_TIMESTAMP.keras

Download these files to your local machine:
# 1. final_enhanced_model_TIMESTAMP.keras
# 2. enhanced_results_summary_TIMESTAMP.json  
# 3. prediction_function_TIMESTAMP.py
