# SkinDiseaseMLApp

This project is a full-stack application designed to classify skin diseases using machine learning. It is organized into two main components:

## ðŸ”§ Project Structure

- **frontend/**: This directory contains the user-facing application, built to provide a clean and interactive interface for users to upload images and view classification results.
  
- **backend/**: This folder includes the Machine Learning (ML) algorithm responsible for classifying the uploaded skin disease images. It handles data preprocessing, model prediction, and API endpoints for frontend communication.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Upload skin disease images through the web interface
- Real-time predictions using a trained ML model
- Responsive UI for ease of use on desktop and mobile devices
- Backend API built for scalability and easy integration

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React (or specify if using another framework), HTML/CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask or FastAPI (specify which), scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (specify ML library used)
- **Model**: Trained image classification model using convolutional neural networks (CNN)
